    "A base LLM (Large Language Model) is a general-purpose model trained on large text datasets to predict the next word in a sequence, making it versatile for tasks like creative writing or general text generation. However, it may not always follow instructions precisely or produce structured responses. In contrast, instruct models are fine-tuned versions of base LLMs, specifically trained on datasets that pair instructions with their corresponding outputs. This fine-tuning helps instruct models better understand and follow explicit instructions, making them more reliable for tasks like summarization, question-answering, and other task-oriented generation, where the model is expected to provide structured and coherent responses."
